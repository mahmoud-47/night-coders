** Problem Description **

You are given an integer number. 
You need to compute the alternating sum of its digits, starting with addition for the first digit.

That is:
    result = 1st_digit - 2nd_digit + 3rd_digit - 4th_digit + 5th_digit - ...

Return the final result as an integer.

---
Example 1

Input :
num = 1234

Output: -2

Explanation:
    1 - 2 + 3 - 4 = -2

---
Example 2

Input :
num = 98765

Output: 5

Explanation:
    9 - 8 + 7 - 6 + 5 = 7

Constraints:
    - 1 <= num <= 10^18
    - The input number will not have leading zeros.
    - The result must be returned as an integer.
